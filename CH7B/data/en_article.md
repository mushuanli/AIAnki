Nǐ hǎo! My name is Li Mengtian.

My family lives in the south of Beijing. Our flat is on the twenty-second floor. It is not big, but we have a nice balcony. I like to look at the nice view of the city there. I often help my parents in the kitchen and share stories about school with them.

Hello! I’m Neil.

I live in a town 15 miles from London. My family and I live in a house with two floors. We love to relax in our living room and chat over a cup of tea. I like the garden best. My brother Tom and I like to water the flowers. We always have fun with our dog there too!

Ahlān! I’m Femi.

I’m from a village near Cairo. There are seven people in my family. We often eat our meals together on a carpet. Next to our farmhouse is a yard. We keep some hens there. My sister and I like to collect the eggs. That’s my favourite part of the day. We also have a cotton field by the Nile River. During the busy season, we children often help in the field.

*** U1 Write: My dream home

My dream home is a house with two floors, away from the city centre.

It has a nice garden with lots of flowers and trees. I can smell the flowers and hear the birds sing. On the first floor, there is a balcony. I love to sit there at night and look at the stars in the sky.

The house is big, so my grandparents can live with us and we can take good care of them. At the weekend, we often have a big dinner. After that, I enjoy playing Chinese chess with Grandpa. Sometimes I help Mum and Dad with some cleaning.

This is my dream home. I love it!

Amy: Hi, Simon. What are your neighbours like?

Simon: They’re kind and helpful. Some of them are volunteers. They often meet at the community centre and share their skills. They help us with all kinds of problems.

Amy: That’s nice! When do they usually meet?

Simon: They have a “helping hands” meeting at the weekend.

Amy: Are you going to ask for help this weekend?

Simon: Yes. There’s something wrong with my laptop. I’m going to ask a computer engineer to check it. My sister Annie’s bicycle is broken, so she’s going to have someone repair it.

Amy: Can anyone there help kids with their homework?

Simon: Yes. Some college students are willing to help.

Amy: Great! Do the old people get any help as well?

Simon: Yes. The volunteers often visit the old people and do some shopping for them. This weekend, they’ll help the old people tidy their flats.

Amy: That’s wonderful! You’re lucky to live in such a nice neighbourhood, Simon.

Hello, everyone,

Today, I’d like to share with you my idea for helping our community. I want to organize an activity—“Collect and Share”. Let’s collect old things from the neighbourhood and give them a new life.

First, we can give away some of our old books. We’re going to share them in our community centre. Second, we’re going to collect old toys. We’ll clean them and then give them to children in need. Last, we’re going to ask for some old clothes. We’ll sell them to raise money for plants and flowers in our community garden.

I hope you like my idea. Let’s work together to make our community a better place!

Welcome to Beijing, the capital of China! Let me show you around my hometown.

In the centre of Beijing is the Palace Museum. It was once the palace of some emperors in ancient China. With wonderful buildings and art treasures inside, it’s well worth a visit.

Next to the Palace Museum is Tian’anmen Square. Many visitors like to come early in the morning to watch the raising of the national flag.

If you want to know more about traditional Beijing life, why not visit a siheyuan? It’s a group of four traditional Chinese houses in a square. There’s a house on each side and a courtyard in the middle. There are hutong between the siheyuan. You can get a taste of the past through the hutong.

Feeling hungry? Try some delicious Beijing duck. You’ll love it! At night, remember to enjoy Beijing opera at one of the local theatres. It’s wonderful. Don’t miss it!

*** U3 Write: Beautiful Brighton

My hometown Brighton is a beautiful seaside city in the south of the UK. It takes about an hour by train to get to Brighton from London.

When you visit Brighton, go for a walk by the sea. The view along the beach is wonderful. You can also try some traditional British food like fish and chips. They are delicious! Then go to Brighton Fishing Museum to see old boats and tools, and learn about the local people’s traditional way of life.

At the end of your day, do not miss the amazing sunset. When the sun is setting, everything seems to be golden.

You will have a great time in Brighton and remember this trip for a long time.

*** U4 Read: Paper-cutting—an art full of life

Zhao Yue’s hands move quickly. She is working on a picture of bamboo. “I love paper-cutting,” she says. “You don’t need much to start working—just a pair of scissors or a knife and some paper. Anyone can try it,” she adds.

After years of practice, Zhao Yue is now a great master of paper-cutting. Her works on the walls in her home are beautiful. They are in the shape of flowers, birds, fish and landscapes.

“Paper-cuts are not just beautiful. We use them to express our wishes. At the Spring Festival, we put them up on windows and doors for good luck,” says Zhao Yue. “And at weddings, we put up ‘double happiness’ in the new couple’s home for good wishes.”

Zhao Yue makes the last cut. She hands me the bamboo picture, smiling. “This is called zhubaoping’an. It means ‘I wish you a safe and healthy life’.” The bamboo seems to be alive and the leaves look like they are dancing. I feel the warmth and life of this traditional folk art.

*** U4 Write: Huizhou inkstick

The Huizhou inkstick is among the best of its kind. It gets its name from the old Huizhou area, largely in today’s Anhui Province. The Huizhou inkstick has a history of over 1,000 years and was very popular with ancient Chinese writers and painters.

The Huizhou inkstick uses pine wood as its main material. It is very difficult to make. Usually the making of such an inkstick takes over a year. The Huizhou inkstick is beautiful, and some people say the inkstick itself is a work of art.

The Huizhou inkstick is famous for its great quality and design. As a fine example of traditional Chinese folk art, the Huizhou inkstick is an important part of Chinese culture.

*** U5 Read: My dog

My dog is the cleverest animal of all.
He doesn’t just run after a ball.
He can do wonderful tricks,
And loves to collect sticks.
He never bites,
And doesn’t like fights.
He can sit and he can stay,
He loves to eat and he loves to play.
My dog is my very best friend,
And I’ll look after him till the end.

My cat

My cat has soft fur,
And loves to purr.
She can jump really high,
Way up into the sky.

She has a pair of blue eyes,
And likes to run after butterflies.
Sometimes she climbs a tall tree,
But never forgets to come back to me.

When I’m lonely, she’s always there.
She can’t speak, but does care.
When I need a friend or feel sad,
She is always by my side.

*** U5 Write: Teddy: my amazing animal friend

I have a pet guinea pig named Teddy. He is white and brown and has short fur. With a big head, short legs and a small round body, he looks quite cute.

Teddy eats grass and vegetables every day. He enjoys running around the house and playing with his toys.

Teddy is quiet and friendly. He seldom makes loud noises and he is always happy to see me. When I come home from school, he runs after me, and that makes me feel happy. If I am down, Teddy will stay next to me and help me relax. He always makes me feel better.

We have so much fun together. I think he is the best pet in the world.

*** U6 Read: Hello from different landscapes

I am a river. I have two faces. I give life: my water is fresh water, so everybody can drink it and use it for farming and washing. But I am also very powerful. When I flood, I sometimes destroy homes and lives. Nothing can get in my way.

I am a desert. My body is mostly made of sand and I seldom see rain. I am very hot during the day and very cold at night. Nobody wants to live in such difficult conditions, but a few plants and animals can survive. How amazing!

I am the ocean. I am huge. I cover more than two-thirds of the earth’s surface, so people call the earth the “Blue Planet”. What a beautiful name! I am home to hundreds of thousands of living things.

I am a forest. I am full of trees, and I produce oxygen for humans and animals to breathe. I wear different colours in different seasons, usually green in summer and golden in autumn.

*** U6 Write: Huangshan, more than beautiful

Huangshan is in the south of Anhui Province in East China. It is only about 1,900 metres high, but it is one of the most amazing mountains in China.

Huangshan is famous for its pine trees and rocks in strange shapes, a wonderful sea of clouds, and relaxing hot springs. In winter, snow covers the mountain and it becomes a white wonderland.

There are several ways to enjoy the beauty of Huangshan. You can walk up paths and steps to the top or take a cable car. From the top, you can enjoy an amazing view. Many people like to stay overnight on the mountain to watch the sunrise or sunset. It is a fantastic view.

Yesterday I went on a cycling trip with my friends. It was an amazing experience!

After breakfast, we set off for a little village. We followed the map, but it did not give enough details about the countryside. We got lost! None of us knew the right way. I was a little worried, but luckily, a driver stopped and told us which way to go.

We cycled for another hour and then arrived at the village. We were all excited. The village is in a beautiful and quiet area. After lunch, we walked around and saw all kinds of interesting flowers and plants. I used an app to find out more about them. We took some great photos. It was really enjoyable!

On our way back, Sandy’s bike had a problem. Daniel took out his tools. We all helped repair Sandy’s bike. We were a little tired, but we were proud of our teamwork.

It was a great day! We had a lot of fun and learnt about nature. I can’t wait to do it again.

Yesterday I went on a hiking trip with my friends and my uncle. We took a bus to the local forest early in the morning and started walking before it got too hot.

The first part of the walk was easy. We walked along a small river. The sky was blue. It was very relaxing and I took lots of photos with my camera.

However, things became difficult because the path was very narrow. We had to support each other. We were excited when we saw the path roll out in front of us.

The trip was a little tiring, but I really enjoyed it. It was a great chance to be close to nature.

*** U8 Read: Down the rabbit hole

One sunny day, Alice and her sister sat by a river. Then Alice heard a sound. She looked up and saw a white rabbit in a coat passing by.

“Oh dear! I’ll be late!” said the rabbit. It took a watch out of its pocket and looked at the time.

How amazing! Alice stood up and ran across the field after the rabbit. The rabbit jumped down a big hole. Alice did not want to let the rabbit get away, so she jumped down the hole too.

Down, down, down. Alice fell for a long time, and then she hit the ground. She found herself alone in a long, low hall. There were doors all around, but they were all locked. Alice saw a small key on a table, but it did not fit any of the doors.

Then Alice noticed a small door and put the key into the lock. The door opened! She could see a lovely garden on the other side. Alice tried to go through the door, but she was too big.

*** U8 Write: 
Alice did not know what to do. Then she went back to the table and saw a little bottle on it. A note on the bottle said “DRINK ME”.

Alice opened the bottle and drank a little. It tasted sweet and Alice liked it very much. She drank some more. Then she felt a little ill. Suddenly, her body became smaller and smaller.

Soon Alice was small enough to go through the door, so she decided to enter the garden. When she walked towards the door, she found that she did not have the key.

Alice had to go back to the table, but she was too small to reach the key. She tried to climb up, but failed. Then she saw a piece of cake in a box under the table. A note on the box said “EAT ME”.
