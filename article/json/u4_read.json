She is working on a picture of bamboo. “I love paper-cutting,” she says. “You don’t need much to start working—just a pair of scissors or a knife and some paper. Anyone can try it,” she adds.\n\nAfter years of practice, Zhao Yue is now a great master of paper-cutting. Her works on the walls in her home are beautiful. They are in the shape of flowers, birds, fish and landscapes.\n\n“Paper-cuts are not just beautiful. We use them to express our wishes. At the Spring Festival, we put them up on windows and doors for good luck,” says Zhao Yue. “And at weddings, we put up ‘double happiness’ in the new couple’s home for good wishes.”\n\nZhao Yue makes the last cut. She hands me the bamboo picture, smiling. “This is called zhubaoping’an. It means ‘I wish you a safe and healthy life’.” The bamboo seems to be alive and the leaves look like they are dancing. I feel the warmth and life of this traditional folk art.",
