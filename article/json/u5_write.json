  "text": "I have a pet guinea pig named Teddy. He is white and brown and has short fur. With a big head, short legs and a small round body, he looks quite cute.\n\nTeddy eats grass and vegetables every day. He enjoys running around the house and playing with his toys.\n\nTeddy is quiet and friendly. He seldom makes loud noises and he is always happy to see me. When I come home from school, he runs after me, and that makes me feel happy. If I am down, Teddy will stay next to me and help me relax. He always makes me feel better.\n\nWe have so much fun together. I think he is the best pet in the world.",
