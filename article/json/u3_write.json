  "text": "My hometown Brighton is a beautiful seaside city in the south of the UK. It takes about an hour by train to get to Brighton from London.\n\nWhen you visit Brighton, go for a walk by the sea. The view along the beach is wonderful. You can also try some traditional British food like fish and chips. They are delicious! Then go to Brighton Fishing Museum to see old boats and tools, and learn about the local people’s traditional way of life.\n\nAt the end of your day, do not miss the amazing sunset. When the sun is setting, everything seems to be golden.\n\nYou will have a great time in Brighton and remember this trip for a long time.",
