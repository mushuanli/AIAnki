  "text": "Yesterday I went on a hiking trip with my friends and my uncle. We took a bus to the local forest early in the morning and started walking before it got too hot.\n\nThe first part of the walk was easy. We walked along a small river. The sky was blue. It was very relaxing and I took lots of photos with my camera.\n\nHowever, things became difficult because the path was very narrow. We had to support each other. We were excited when we saw the path roll out in front of us.\n\nThe trip was a little tiring, but I really enjoyed it. It was a great chance to be close to nature.",
