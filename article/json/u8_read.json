  "text": "One sunny day, Alice and her sister sat by a river. Then Alice heard a sound. She looked up and saw a white rabbit in a coat passing by.\n\n“Oh dear! I’ll be late!” said the rabbit. It took a watch out of its pocket and looked at the time.\n\nHow amazing! Alice stood up and ran across the field after the rabbit. The rabbit jumped down a big hole. Alice did not want to let the rabbit get away, so she jumped down the hole too.\n\nDown, down, down. Alice fell for a long time, and then she hit the ground. She found herself alone in a long, low hall. There were doors all around, but they were all locked. Alice saw a small key on a table, but it did not fit any of the doors.\n\nThen Alice noticed a small door and put the key into the lock. The door opened! She could see a lovely garden on the other side. Alice tried to go through the door, but she was too big.",
