  "text": "Yesterday I went on a cycling trip with my friends. It was an amazing experience!\n\nAfter breakfast, we set off for a little village. We followed the map, but it did not give enough details about the countryside. We got lost! None of us knew the right way. I was a little worried, but luckily, a driver stopped and told us which way to go.\n\nWe cycled for another hour and then arrived at the village. We were all excited. The village is in a beautiful and quiet area. After lunch, we walked around and saw all kinds of interesting flowers and plants. I used an app to find out more about them. We took some great photos. It was really enjoyable!\n\nOn our way back, Sandy’s bike had a problem. Daniel took out his tools. We all helped repair Sandy’s bike. We were a little tired, but we were proud of our teamwork.\n\nIt was a great day! We had a lot of fun and learnt about nature. I can’t wait to do it again.",
