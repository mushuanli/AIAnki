  "text": "My dream home is a house with two floors, away from the city centre.\n\nIt has a nice garden with lots of flowers and trees. I can smell the flowers and hear the birds sing. On the first floor, there is a balcony. I love to sit there at night and look at the stars in the sky.\n\nThe house is big, so my grandparents can live with us and we can take good care of them. At the weekend, we often have a big dinner. After that, I enjoy playing Chinese chess with Grandpa. Sometimes I help Mum and Dad with some cleaning.\n\nThis is my dream home. I love it!",
